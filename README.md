# youtubeplaylistmp3  
Takes a youtube playlist and converts it into mp3 files  
what you need:  
python (I used 2.7?), and install selenium (http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html)  
you need to edit 2 lines in the python script.  
  
1. Edit the location of the webdriver  
2. Get the url of the first song in the playlist.  
  
run the python script & sit back n enjoy! it should take 2-3 seconds per song.  
  
Tips:  
Selenium is very fickle. It is advised not touch your computer while its working  
make sure the computer also does not go to sleep  
Empty the downloads folder before to make copy/pasting the songs a lot easier
