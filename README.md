# ---------- youtube playlist to mp3 ----------


Takes a youtube playlist and converts it into mp3 files  


# ---------------- INSTRUCTIONS ----------------


Requirements: Python 2.7, and Selenium (http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html)  


Edit 2 lines in the python script.  
  
  
1. Edit the location of the webdriver.  
2. Get the url of the first song in the playlist.  
  
  
Run the python script and wait for it to finish exectuting. It should take 2-3 seconds per song, plus the download time.  
 
 
# -------------------- TIPS -------------------- 


Selenium is very fickle.   
I suggest running this while away from your computer, and making sure that it wont go to sleep.  
Empty the downloads folder before to make copy/pasting the songs a lot easier to the directory of choice.
